	abstract = "We use the Nielsen Consumer Panel to investigate the impact of tobacco control policies on purchases of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), cigarettes, and smoking cessation products. We measure product quantity, product type, nicotine content, and liquid volume of e-cigarettes, and product quantity and nicotine content of cigarettes. Higher cigarette excise taxes decrease both cigarette and e-cigarette purchases, suggesting that cigarettes and e-cigarettes are complements, and higher cigarette excise taxes reduce the aggregate amount of nicotine purchased from cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Cigarette smoke-free air laws decrease cigarette purchases, while e-cigarette smoke-free air laws do not affect cigarette or e-cigarette purchases."

	abstract = "Parallels and contrasts between tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking are considered, in terms of harms, cultural positioning, and a dependence, which is social as well as physical and psychological. Evidence is briefly reviewed of two kinds of conjunction: of being a smoker and being a drinker, and of the smoking event and the drinking event. The complementary relation between smoking and drinking, it is argued, can be understood at physiological, psychological and social levels. Implications for prevention, intervention and policy are discussed, including the need for international agreement on alcohol as well as tobacco control."

	abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper adopts a systems approach to estimate budget share equations for four categories of alcoholic drinks and for tobacco, using quarterly expenditure data for the period 1964 to 1983. The emphasis is on the importance of the tolerance effects of addiction and on the smoker's participation decision in correctly specifying the model of demand. The model makes explicit recognition of a separate participation decision and the estimates suggest that there is something to be gained by introducing variables to indicate changes in the distribution of income and the demographic structure of the population.},

	abstract = {Taxation of cigarettes and alcohol can raise revenue and reduce consumption of goods with negative external effects. Despite medical and psychological evidence linking their consumption, little previous work has investigated the significance of cross-price effects in cigarette and alcohol consumption.  We use individual-level data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to investigate cigarette and alcohol consumption in the US, estimating both own and cross-price elasticities. Results suggest significant cross-price effects. Specifically, we find that higher alcohol prices decrease both alcohol consumption and smoking participation (suggesting a complementarity in consumption), while higher cigarette prices tend to decrease smoking participation but increase drinking. The significance of these findings suggests that further work is warranted to better understand the social and economic relationship between cigarette and alcohol consumption.},
